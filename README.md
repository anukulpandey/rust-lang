# Rust Playground

Hey there this is Chapter-1 Branch , there are multiple branches in this git repo. And each branch represents a new chapter . So make sure to check the branches if you want to learn something.

- cargo new <project_name> to create a new project 
- use cargo build to build it
- use cargo run to build and run the project
- cargo build generates executable everytime and takes time, so to check syntax use cargo check
